This is my repo on recreating the Gapminder visualization using PowerBI. The question that I have know is:
"Will COVID19 alter the current trend? Will there be a significant change on this plot for the year 2020?"

<i><b>Note:</b> Data as of 7/7/2021</i>

<h3 id="Why are they important?">Why are they important?</h3>
Over the past decade, Ireland has grown into a Global Technology hub. Ireland, being the second largest exporter of computer and IT services in the world, has successfully attracted 9 of the top 10 global Information Technology companies to establish a significant presence here. As a result, there has been a great increase in the number of international students who want to pursue their career in Technology. Also, the figure of incoming international students is expected to rise even more rapidly in coming years.<br>
<br>
In the past five years, 25,000 new jobs have been announced by the Tech sector in Ireland. With almost two thousand additional graduates required by the sector every year from 2018. There are massive opportunities for students who pursue relevant third level courses. Hence, our target audience, the student community, is an important aspect in the growth of Ireland.

<h3 id="What problem are we solving for them?">What problem are we solving for them?</h3>
At present, there is no all-in-one platform where students could get all the information they need regarding the subject of their interest. Students willing to pursue their careers in Technology face difficulty to realize which skills are in high demand in the Irish market. We wanted to provide them details that would guide them in choosing the modules during their graduate/undergraduate studies. This would also help them study the job market and find the events happening around them related to those skills. They can also connect with like-minded people by attending events in their area. <br>

Information we will be providing can be divided into four categories:</div>

- <div align="justify">Events for enhancing skills and networking.</div>
- <div align="justify">Open job positions and job insights that will help them make educated decisions about their career.<br>
- <div align="justify">Most recent news articles related to the skills.</div>
- <div align="justify">Most recent Twitter feed related to the skills.</div>

<div align="justify">In addition, we will provide our users with interactive dashboards containing insights gained from combination of four categories mentioned above. Some of these insights will include visualizations such as:<br></div>

- <div align="justify"> Most popular Meetup group in Ireland.</div>
- <div align="justify"> Most popular events happening in Ireland.</div>
- <div align="justify"> Top IT skills in the Irish market. </div>
- <div align="justify"> Counties having maximum number of job openings in Ireland. </div>
- <div align="justify"> Top companies hiring in Ireland. </div>
- <div align="justify"> Top companies in terms of work life balance rating.</div>
- <div align="justify"> Most popular Job titles in Ireland based on filtered IT skill(s). </div>
- <div align="justify"> Highest paid jobs in Ireland based on filtered IT skill(s). </div>
- <div align="justify"> Most difficult Job Interviews based on filtered IT skill(s). </div>
- <div align="justify"> Top trending IT skills based on the latest News articles being published.</div>
