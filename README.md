<div align="justify"><h3 id="Who is our target user?">Who is our target user?</h3>
Our objective is to develop a website which can serve as a go-to place for all the information associated with Information Technology in Ireland. Our target audience were students who are willing to pursue their career in IT related fields. The website we developed can be used by all students to identify top IT skills in the market and the job opportunities related to that skill as well as corresponding events happening around them. Along with this, we are also providing them with latest news and twitter feed related to that skill.<br><br>

<i><b>Note:</b> Initially, our target user group was only IT students. But, we realized that there might be students from different background who wish to pursue their careers in IT.</i>

<h3 id="Why are they important?">Why are they important?</h3>
Over the past decade, Ireland has grown into a Global Technology hub. Ireland, being the second largest exporter of computer and IT services in the world, has successfully attracted 9 of the top 10 global Information Technology companies to establish a significant presence here. As a result, there has been a great increase in the number of international students who want to pursue their career in Technology. Also, the figure of incoming international students is expected to rise even more rapidly in coming years.<br>
<br>
In the past five years, 25,000 new jobs have been announced by the Tech sector in Ireland. With almost two thousand additional graduates required by the sector every year from 2018. There are massive opportunities for students who pursue relevant third level courses. Hence, our target audience, the student community, is an important aspect in the growth of Ireland.
<br>

<h3 id="What problem are we solving for them?">What problem are we solving for them?</h3>
At present, there is no all-in-one platform where students could get all the information they need regarding the subject of their interest. Students willing to pursue their careers in Technology face difficulty to realize which skills are in high demand in the Irish market. We wanted to provide them details that would guide them in choosing the modules during their graduate/undergraduate studies. This would also help them study the job market and find the events happening around them related to those skills. They can also connect with like-minded people by attending events in their area. <br>

Information we will be providing can be divided into four categories:</div>

- <div align="justify">Events for enhancing skills and networking.</div>
- <div align="justify">Open job positions and job insights that will help them make educated decisions about their career.<br>
- <div align="justify">Most recent news articles related to the skills.</div>
- <div align="justify">Most recent Twitter feed related to the skills.</div>

<div align="justify">In addition, we will provide our users with interactive dashboards containing insights gained from combination of four categories mentioned above. Some of these insights will include visualizations such as:<br></div>

- <div align="justify"> Most popular Meetup group in Ireland.</div>
- <div align="justify"> Most popular events happening in Ireland.</div>
- <div align="justify"> Top IT skills in the Irish market. </div>
- <div align="justify"> Counties having maximum number of job openings in Ireland. </div>
- <div align="justify"> Top companies hiring in Ireland. </div>
- <div align="justify"> Top companies in terms of work life balance rating.</div>
- <div align="justify"> Most popular Job titles in Ireland based on filtered IT skill(s). </div>
- <div align="justify"> Highest paid jobs in Ireland based on filtered IT skill(s). </div>
- <div align="justify"> Most difficult Job Interviews based on filtered IT skill(s). </div>
- <div align="justify"> Top trending IT skills based on the latest News articles being published.</div>
- <div align="justify"> Trend of number of published News articles related to IT skills. </div>
